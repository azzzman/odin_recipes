        <h3> Description: </h3>
        <p> Chile Lime Shrimp with Pineapple Salsa… super easy, healthy, and full of flavour. 
            They also cook in no time at all! We had them over a bed of steamed jasmine rice, 
            but this combo goes great with some fried plantains, yuca or sautéed vegetables. </p>
        <p> Also incredible as a taco! Adding a bit of butter at the end is optional, 
            but it will add a lot of flavour to the shrimp. You can omit it to keep things Whole30 or 
            substitute ghee </p>

            <h4> For the cajun shrimp: </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> In a bowl, combine the shrimp, 1 tablespoon olive oil, chile powder, paprika, onion powder,
