        <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1.5 pounds store-bought pizza dough </li>
                <li> 1/2 scant cup extra virgin olive oil </li>
                <li> 8 cloves garlic </li>
                <li> 4 sprigs fresh rosemary </li>
                <li> Flaky salt </li>
            </ul>
        <h3> Steps: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> If time allows, place the pizza dough in a lightly greased bowl and allow it to come to room temperature. 
                    Using a bench scraper or a sharp knife, cut the dough ball into 12 even slices. 
                    They do not have to be perfect. Avoid overworking the dough. </li>
                <li> In a standard muffin pan, pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil into each muffin cup. </li>
                <li> Gently shape each piece of dough into a rough ball and place it into the oiled muffin pan. 
                    Try not to deflate the air bubbles. Cover the pan with a towel and let it rest near the oven while 
                    it preheats. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. The warmth will help the dough rise. </li>
                <li> While the dough rests, chop the garlic. Remove the leaves from the sprigs of rosemary and chop. Set aside. </li>
                <li> Heat the remaining olive oil over medium heat. Wet your fingertips and flick a small drop of water 
                    into the oil. If it sizzles, it is hot enough. Remove the hot oil from the stove and carefully add 
                    the garlic and rosemary. Stir until the oil stops sizzling. </li>
                <li> Spoon a generous amount of the oil onto each dough ball. Use all of it. </li>
                <li> Using two fingers, press into the dough to create lots of dimples and help the garlic and rosemary to adhere. </li>
                <li> Bake for 14-16 minutes. Loosely cover with foil if the tops are browning too quickly. </li>
            </ol>
